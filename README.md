# Data Science Projects

These are projects where I've worked with data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning either as a personal project, research, or as a classroom
assignment! I'm a microbiologist by training but fell in love with data science during my very first Python programming course in my undergraduate junior year. Now I
work with machine learning and deep learning algorithms to research and design therapeutics for cancer drugs! I enjoy creating informative yet fun data visualization for a broader audience and analyzing data to help inform people and aid in their decision-making.

My passion projects include analysis of trends in climate, health and disease, economics, and predictive modeling on big data
